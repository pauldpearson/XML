            Since our first vintage from the Jack London Ranch in 1976 it has proven itself as an outstanding producer
            of exceptional Cabernet Sauvignon. Located midway up the Eastern flanks of Sonoma Mountain it has a long
            mild growing season that creates fruit with complexity and balance. The influence of the vineyard's red
            volcanic soil and the fruity characteristics of the grapes combine to produce an outstanding, very
            distinctive Cabernet Sauvignon.

            Superior Pinot Noir from Sonoma Coast always seems to be $30 and up. Angels Landing is a steal at 16.99!
            Angels Landing has become a familiar name for great value just like Robert Mondavi, Deloach, etc. Not only
            do they make a great Napa Cabernet for the money, but also this Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir that drinks more
            like a $30 bottle of wine.

        <notes>We love Pinot Noir and in many years make about 15 of them with fruit from the Russian River Valley,
            Sonoma Coast, Green Valley, Carneros, Anderson Valley, Marin and Oregon appellations. We feel that Pinot
            Noir makes the most seductive red wine, notable for its supple, silky texture. Pinot Noir is also known for
            expressing vineyard site characteristics in a transparent manner.

        <notes>A succulent wine with aromas of lavender, cranberries and minty floral Asian spice. This is textbook
            Cabernet Sauvignon and highlights how well McLaren Vale is situated to growing it. Color: Dark red with a
            vibrant hue. Aroma: Notes of red current, plum, bay leaf, juniper, wet clay and graphite. Palate: Round yet
            fine and detailed, this medium bodied wine is brimming with lovely fruit density. Notes of red current,
            cassis, black cherry, and plum lead the charge, supported by secondary notes of bay leaf, graphite, wet clay
            and chocolate. Starting early, tannins are savoury in nature and run long through the palate complimented by
            lovely accents of ash and coal dust. Dense and chewy through to the finish, this wine has excellent length.

        <origin>FRA</origin>
        <notes>For the red Chateauneuf, Clos des Papes uses up to 20% of Mourvedre in the blend. Grenache and Syrah are
            the other main components at around 50% and 10% respectively, with the balance being a mix of all the other
            permitted varieties. Clos des Papes is one of the few estates to use all permitted varieties for both red
            and white Chateauneuf. They are well-known for producing one of the most authentic and long-lived examples
            of the appellation having started estate bottling in 1896. The white Chateauneuf-du-Pape also ages extremely
            well providing great drinking pleasure for 20 years or more.

            TRE stands for the three grape varieties Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon and for our three Tuscan
            estates, the basis for this wine. TRE was also our third label in 2000 so we have three good reasons to name
            it Brancaia TRE. This elegant and well structured wine, matches every cuisine. Pair with various pasta
            dishes, roasted and sautéed white meat, white poultry, fried and grilled fish.

        <notes>Château Puech-Haut has been on the critic's radar for some time - which makes sense since the property
            has employed Michel Rolland, Claude Gros and now Philippe Cambie as consulting enologist. Visionary owner
            Gérard Bru spares no expense in his quest for excellence. Located quite close to Pic Saint-Loup, in
            Saint-Drézéry, Puech-Haut is near the far western border of the Rhône valley and benefits from both its
            proximity to the mediterranean and the rugged, mountainous interior of France. There are slightly over 50
            hectares planted with Grenache, Syrah, Mourvedre, Cinsault, Carignan, Viognier, Marsanne, Roussanne,
            Grenache Blanc and Carignan Blanc. The wines from Puech-Haut are rich and lush but also show the earthy and
            mineral character of the rocky clay-limestone soils of the region.

            body, and interesting, silky tannins. It unites potency and elegance and looks like having a promising
            future. With its tempting perfumes of red berries and its clean freshness, the complexity of this wine
            presents an excellent balance. To fully appreciate its qualities, decant the wine at least one hour before
            serving.

            peaches. Floral notes come through on the nose and carry over to the palate, along with flavors of berries,
            pomegranate and citrus. Both dry and round, layers of delicate and intense fruit flavors add a degree of
            character that can be elusive in a Rosé. The finish on this wine is light and bright, with a floral quality
            blending seamlessly with the lushness of its fruit.

        <notes>Named after an old estate located in the heart of Domaine Lafage, Mas Miraflors, the Miraflors Rosé is
            sourced from old vines of Grenache Gris, nearing 80 years old, planted near the Mediterranean. Added to this
            is some Mourvedre that Jean-Marc planted here about 15 years ago. This a direct press rosé with the color
            coming from the skins of the pink Grenache Gris berries, and naturally, from the much darker Mourvedre. It
            is aged in tank for 4 months before bottling.

        <notes>The 2013 Savoy Anderson Valley Chardonnay is light straw in color. Simultaneously driven by its fruit and

            nose along with a slight flintiness. While the fruit tones remain on the palette, the mineral flintiness
            gives way to chalkiness, adding to the complexity. Additional elements of citrus blossom, white pepper and
            parsley round out the nose and palette of this wine, lending it to pair gracefully with fresh, simple
            ingredients. Drinking well in the present yet will reward a patient cellarer.

        <notes>Someone once made an unflattering comparison between Chardonnay and a part of one's anatomy best left
            unmentioned, saying, "everyone's got one, no one wants to hear about yours." Sadly Chardonnay is a victim of
            its own success and frequently a punch line despite being one of the most highly esteemed wines in its guise
            of Grand Cru Chablis or Montrachet. We are not claiming that Novellum is like these auspicious wines but we
            will argue that for its price you can hardly find better. For many years we worked with a cooperative in the
            Languedoc to make Novellum from a special site that in most years had some botrytis, giving the wine weight
            without resorting to oak. Since that time we've moved the project to the Roussillon where Jean-Marc and
            Eliane Lafage have some Chardonnay planted near the Mediterranean that makes a remarkably complex and
            mineral version of the variety. There is no botrytis here so we resort to a small percentage in barrel -
            usually less than 20%. The remainder of the wine is aged in tank on the lees of Viognier. It remains one of
            the best values in Chardonnay that you can find.

        <notes>The nose opens with bursts of orange blossoms and hints of lemon cream pie. The palate is full yet
            bright, offering a pleasant viscosity and subtle notes of kiwi. The clean finish adds an exclamation point
            with elegance. Food Affinities: The perfect balance of body and acidity makes this an ideal food wine. It
            will shine with light dishes featuring shellfish, grilled fish, chicken or pasta with spring vegetables.
            Fresh tarragon as an accent herb works quite well.

        <notes>The 2016 Nautilus Sauvignon Blanc displays intense aromas of ripe passionfruit, elderflower, limes and
            fresh herbs. The palate introduces a delightful lime/citrus based mouth-watering intensity and finishes with
            a strong textural component. Delicious upon release, this wine will improve for 3-5 years post vintage. Try
            with Snapper ceviche with chilli and lime, avocado and tomato, with coriander salsa.
